EKG2 does use autotools package for building. If you are checkouting source code
directly from CVS, you probably need to call:
	$ ./autogen.sh [configure options]
before doing the real build, or:
	$ NOCONFIGURE=1 ./autogen.sh
if you don't want autogen to call configure after creating it.

If you are using some snapshots, this was probably done for you, and you'll only
need to call:
	$ ./configure [configure options]
	$ make
	# make install

To see all available options for configure (or first autogen.sh syntax), please
use '--help'. If compilation fails on one of the plugins, you can append '-k'
flag to make, so it'll ignore the failures (but please report the problem to
the authors).
