   + different ways to part channel:
     /part; /part #fsck; /part irc:#fsck; Alt+k; /window kill
 * I've changed some things, that maybe aren't important now,
   but I hope they will make easier some stuff in the future...

Yesterday iirc
 * changed lot of things, cause I've discoverer I was doing
   really baaad things ;)
 * dealing with RPLs 321, 322, 323, TOPIC, MODE server responses
   [right now I just care about +-[ov], to change colors
    in contactlist]

Explanation: irc-plugin version changes quite quick, because
it's rather built number than version number ;]
The first number I've entered manually was 0.2.40.
Maybe there were more builts, than 240, but ahh yawn, I'm going to bed

client->server: irc.c
server->client: misc.c
channels stuff: people.c
colouring+ctcp: input.c
