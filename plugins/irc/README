* from now on all channel names are kept in lower case,
  mind that, when dealing with channel names,
  before operating on channel name, you should convert
  it's name to lower case BUT using:
  irc_tolower_int or IRC_TOLOWER macro

take a look into command.txt and maybe head Changelog,
I'm too lazy to write readme file ;>
