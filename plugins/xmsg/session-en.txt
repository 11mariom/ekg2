auto_connect
	type: bool
	default value: 1
	
	If set to true, this session will be connected automagically
	on program startup.

max_filesize
	type: integer
	default value: 16384
	
	Files larger than value of this variable won't be read by xmsg plugin.

max_oneshot_files
	type: integer
	default value: 25

	Max count of files that'll be processed during one function call.
	If function reaches that count, it'll break off the loop, and set resume
	timer (see: oneshot_resume_timer). Value of 0 means no limit.

oneshot_resume_timer
	type: integer
	default vlaue: 3

	Delay (in seconds), after which the process, stopped by reaching
	max_oneshot_files, will be resumed. If set to 0, no autoresume'll
	be done (the process'll be resumed on next function call, for example
	on next /connect).

rescan_timer
	type: integer
	default value: 0 or 300
	
	Interval of rescanning incoming message directory. It shouldn't be used
	(and thus is set to 0 by default) in inotify environments.

send_cmd
	type: string
	default value: (none)
	
	Command used to send messages to xmsg plugin; it'll be launched with
	two args - an UID (without xmsg:) and path to file with message inside.
	Note that xmsg doesn't check return value from this handler app/script,
	so errors should be returned by use of session's incoming message dir.

unlink_sent
	type: bool
	default value: 1

	If set to true, incoming message files will be removed after reading.
	Otherwise, xmsg will create dotfiles to mark them.

unlink_toobig
	type: bool
	default value: 0

	If set to true, files larger than max_filesize will be deleted,
	otherwise they'll be ignored (and dotfiles for them will be created).
